This code is for Virtual Urban Air Mobility Network Performance Analysis Simulator. 

It is designed for the purpose of analyzing UAM traffic flow and a discrete event-based simulation. 

Based on the operational concepts presented so far, the characteristics and processes of each stakeholder have been modeled. 

Virtual vertiport network is formed by receiving vertiport information with demand and latitude·longitude coordinates.

You can set design variables that reflect UAM Operator's management strategies such as fleet size, performance, and turnaround time.

So far, output of the simulation consists of status data such as the location and condition of each UAM aircraft and passenger according to time, the passenger's call rejection rate, and the utilization rate of the UAM
aircraft.

This study is still on going at the Korea Aerospace University. 

Debugging and Developing for code is currently in progress, so please give us a lot of feedback and attention.
